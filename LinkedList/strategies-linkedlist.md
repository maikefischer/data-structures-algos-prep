# Solving LinkedList problems strategies

## Traverse + optional collection
- applicable when the problem needs you to:
    - traverse the given linkedlist from start to end whilst validating or finding something, e.g. adding two numbers represented by linked lists

## Two pointers approach
- is applicable when the problem needs you to:
    - perform an operation, given nth node from the end of the list
    - list is cyclic
    - given are two lists that are merged

## Link manipulation
- is applicable when the problem needs you to: 
    - modify the given linked list in-place, e.g. reverse a linked list
    - performa an operation on two linked lists, e.g. merge two sorted lists to give a single sorted list

## Recursion
- is applicable when the problem needs you to: 
    - perform the same operation till a base case has been reached, e.g. reverse a linked list in groups of given size

## k-way merge
- is applicable when the problem needs you to: 
    - given multiple sorted linked lists, merge them into one sorted list
