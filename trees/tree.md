# Trees

## What is a Tree?
- non-linear data structure
- consists of nodes and edges

## Why do we have a Tree Data Structure?
- the sequential form of linear data structures, therefore time complexity increases with data size O(n)
- tree data structures allow easier and quicker access to the data elements

## Terminology
- Node: contains value and pointers to the children
- Edge: connecting links between two nodes
- Root: parent of all nodes
- Parent: a node's predecessor
- Child: a node's descendant
- Leaf node: a node which does not have any children
- Height of tree: total number of edges from leaf to root, longest path

# Type of trees
## Binary tree
![alt text](binary-tree.png "Binary Tree")
- each parent node has at most two children (one child is also possible)

## Binary search tree
![alt text](binary-search-tree.png "Binary Tree")
- each parent node has at most two children (one child is also possible)
- all nodes of the left subtree are less than the root node
- all nodes of the right subtree are more than the root node
